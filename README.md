# IPL-Win-Predictor
Predict IPL match winning probability using Streamlit and ML
# 🏏 IPL Live Win Probability Predictor

A collaborative Machine Learning project that predicts the winning probability of an IPL match using live match conditions through a Streamlit web application.

# 📌 Overview

The app predicts the batting team’s chances of winning based on:
- Batting & bowling teams
- Venue
- Target runs
- Current score, overs, and wickets
A Logistic Regression model is trained on historical IPL data to generate probability-based predictions.

# 🚀 Features

- Live win probability prediction
- Interactive Streamlit UI
- Logistic Regression model
- Real-time match-state calculations (CRR, RRR)

# 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python 
- Streamlit 
- Pandas 
- NumPy 
- Scikit-learn

# 📊 Dataset

Historical IPL match data (ipl.csv) used for model training.

# ⭐ Acknowledgement

This project was developed as part of an internship for learning and educational purposes, using publicly available IPL match data.
